# Local LLM Agent

This project provides a powerful framework for building and running AI agents locally using open-source Large Language Models (LLMs). By leveraging a local setup, you can ensure data privacy and reduce dependency on external APIs, all while maintaining powerful agentic capabilities.

## ‚ú® Features
* **Local-First Architecture:** Runs entirely on your machine for maximum privacy and control.
* **Agentic Framework:** Uses an advanced library to enable multi-step reasoning and tool usage.
* **Tool Integration:** The agent can interact with various custom tools to perform specific tasks.
* **Modular Design:** Easily swap out different components or models as needed.

## üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites

To get this project up and running, you'll need the following:

* **Python 3.9+**
* **Ollama:** This is essential for running the local LLMs. You **must** have Ollama installed and running a model to use this code.

## üöÄ Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-project-name.git](https://github.com/your-username/your-project-name.git)
    cd your-project-name
    ```

2.  **Install the required Python packages:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Start Ollama and download a model:**
    If you haven't already, start the Ollama server. Then, download a model (e.g., `llama3.1` or one that you already using).
    ```bash
    ollama run llama3.1
    ```

## üèÉ Usage

Once you have the prerequisites installed and Ollama running, you can interact with the agent via the main script.

```bash
python main.py
````

Follow the prompts in the terminal to start a conversation with your local agent.
